## What is dead tuples?
In PostgreSQL, when a row is deleted or updated, PostgreSQL creates so-called Dead tuples. Dead tuples are not referenced in the current version of our databases' tables, but still occupy space on disk.

### How to run vacuum
To run auto vacuum in PostgreSQL, you typically don't have to do anything special. PostgreSQL has a built-in autovacuum process that runs automatically to reclaim storage occupied by dead tuples and update statistics used by the query planner. However, you may need to tune some parameters in your postgresql.conf file to optimize autovacuum's behavior according to your database workload.

Autovacuum does not delete data from tables. Instead, it marks dead tuples (rows that are no longer visible to any transaction) as reusable space within the table. The actual space is reclaimed when new data is inserted or updated in the table. This process helps to prevent database bloat and ensures that your tables remain efficient.

If you want to manually trigger a vacuum operation on a specific table, you can use the VACUUM command. For example:

sql
Copy code
VACUUM FULL my_table;
The VACUUM FULL variant will also compact the table by rewriting it, potentially reclaiming more space but requiring exclusive locks on the table for the duration of the operation.

Just be cautious with manual vacuum operations, especially VACUUM FULL, as they can be resource-intensive and may impact the performance of your database, especially on large tables.

In summary, autovacuum is a background process that helps maintain the health and performance of your PostgreSQL database by reclaiming space and updating statistics automatically. It does not delete data but rather marks it for reuse.
